        Following the fall of the belligerent Teostra, torrential rainfall has been observed in numerous regions
        of
        the New World. This weather has greatly reduced our Hunters' vision, leading to injuries minor and
        serious
        alike.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
        This weather is speculated to have been caused by a special specimen of Namielle, which is reported to
        have
        a greater influence over the New World weather. Ecosystems across the New World are being severely
        affected,
        causing floods and ruining the local wildlife.
    </p>

        In line with this situation, the Commander has posted a special assignment to all dauntless Hunters willing to take down this new threat and restore balance to the ecosystem. As always, you can approach your Handlers to accept the assignment.
    </p>
    <p class="p4">Stay safe, Hunters. May the Sapphire Star light our way.</p>
