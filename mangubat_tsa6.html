            <p class="desc">Safi'jiiva, the mature manifestation of Xeno'jiiva, possesses a formidable ability to absorb energy from its surroundings, facilitating self-healing and influencing the ecosystem. In its fully-grown state, Safi'jiiva undergoes a significant aesthetic transformation. Its appearance is replaced by rigid, red scales adorned with dark accents on features such as horns, feet, spikes, and wing edges. The wing webbing and underside exhibit a tan hue. Unlike its juvenile form, Safi'jiiva adopts a posture with bent arms and a closer-to-ground chest position. Despite this, it maintains a nearly identical size to its younger counterpart, giving the illusion of diminished scale.</p>
